# buffer-oveflow-dev
I found these online. They are a Sries of Python scripts used to develop a buffer overflow with Immunity Debugger 
for the Brainpan VM found on Vulnhub.com.
Additionaly, they could also be used as templates in crafting a custom buffer overflow attack on a different VM/ target machine.
